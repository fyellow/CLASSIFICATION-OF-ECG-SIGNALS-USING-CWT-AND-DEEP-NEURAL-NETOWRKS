# CLASSIFICATION-OF-ECG-SIGNALS-USING-CWT-AND-DEEP-NEURAL-NETOWRKS
Cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and stroke, remains the leading cause of death around the world.  In the clinical setting, the arrhythmia is usually diagnosed by analyzing the heartbeat of an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Yet most heart attacks and strokes could be prevented if some method of pre-monitoring and pre-diagnostic can be provided. In particular, early detection of abnormalities in the function of the heart, called arrhythmias, can be valuable for clinicians. 
Developing a computer-aided system to automatically detect abnormal heart detection would help the cardiologists make better decisions.
We have built both convolution neural network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Networks (LSTM) for the purpose of classifying ECG signals.
The CNN model yielded an accuracy of around 90 % whereas the LSTM network yielded an accuracy of 80% for the test sets.
